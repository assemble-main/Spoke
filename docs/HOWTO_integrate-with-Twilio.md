# Twilio Integration

You will need to create a Twilio account in order to test outgoing and incoming replies and/or to live text with Heroku or AWS. If you need to use Twilio with live keys, do the following to send messages and receive incoming replies:

## Instructions

### Note

If you are using these instructions for an Heroku instance or AWS Lambda instance, replace references to <YOUR_NGROK_APP_URL> with your actual app url (i.e. examplespokeapp.herokuapp.com )

1.  If you are using these instructions for development (not Heroku), start [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs).

- A reasonable command line for `ngrok` is `ngrok http -subdomain=<UNIQUE_NAME> 3000` (Replace <UNIQUE_NAME> with something likely to be globally unique. Use the same <UNIQUE_NAME> each time you start ngrok. If you use a different <UNIQUE_NAME> it will be necessary to change the configuration in Twilio.)
- When you start `ngrok`, it will display the external-facing app URL. Use that below to replace <YOUR_NGROK_APP_URL>

2.  Create a Twilio acccount: https://www.twilio.com/
3.  Click on `Programmable SMS` on the side panel
4.  Click on `Messaging Services`, and click the plus
5.  Create a friendly name
6.  Under `Properties`

- `SERVICE SID` is `TWILIO_MESSAGE_SERVICE_SID`

7.  Under `Inbound Settings`

- Make sure `PROCESS INBOUND MESSAGES` is selected
- `REQUEST URL` is `https://<YOUR_NGROK_APP_URL>/twilio` (or for Heroku instructions, `https://<YOUR_HEROKU_APP_URL>/twilio`)

8.  Under Outbound Settings

- `STATUS CALLBACK URL` in your Twilio console is `https://<YOUR_NGROK_APP_URL>/twilio-message-report` (or for Heroku instructions, `https://<YOUR_HEROKU_APP_URL>/twilio-message-report`)
- TWILIO_STATUS_CALLBACK_URL in your .env file is `https://<YOUR_NGROK_APP_URL>/twilio-message-report` (or for Heroku instructions, `https://<YOUR_HEROKU_APP_URL>/twilio-message-report`)

9.  Visit the [dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/console)
10. Under `Account Summary`

- `TWILIO_API_KEY` in your .env file (or Heroku config variable) is `ACCOUNT SID` in your Twilio console
- `TWILIO_APPLICATION_SID` is `TWILIO_MESSAGE_SERVICE_SID` (these are the same values)
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in your .env file (or Heroku config variable) is `AUTH TOKEN` in your Twilio console

11. If you want to send live text messages as part of your testing, you must buy a phone number and attach it to your project.

- Click on `Numbers` and press on `+`. Search for a area code and click on buy (trial Twilio accounts give you $15~ to work with). In order to send messages, you will have to connect a credit card with a minimum charge of $20.
